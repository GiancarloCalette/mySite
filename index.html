        <p>Hello, my name is Giancarlo Calette and I'm a <b>senior student</b> in <mark>Mechatronic engineering</mark> from de University of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

        <p>I've working as Mechanical engineer in <i>Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Baja California</i> since 2020 where I get the opportunity to work with latest technologies to build and design automation machines that performs in the automotive industry such as <i>Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Baja California</i>, therefore I provide many <ins>flexible options</ins> to integrate all the needs of the company while also ensuring that the internal proceses are working efficenly such that all the plant can reach all production goals on time. In the project manager department that I've been working with we use the software of Rockwell Automation<sup>R</sup> such as RSLogix<sub>5000</sub>, Studio<sub>5000</sub> and also we use CAD software such as SolidWorks<sub>2019</sub> and AutoCAD<sub>2020</sub> to produce high standard engineering drawings, I consider my self a passionate for PLC programming and all the automation process that involves on my workfield, therefore I'm looking to build a career that give me the opportunity to integrate all my skills in the professional backround, recently I've been developing SCADA applications, in other words we can define SCADA applications as Front-end interface so that the operatar can interact with tha machine. Also the main purpose of a SCADA application is to monitor and control equipment in industrial processes, thus SCADA application provide valuable information to key stakeholder, also one of the biggest reasons that we find this kind of applications almost in everywhere is because the application consists of both software and hardware components and collecting valuable data from the industrial equipment.</p>

        <p>I've also had the opportunity to study for a few months in Berlin, Germany, where I was very happy to learn a differnt lenguage and also a differnt culture, in my personal opinion I consider one of the most important moments of my life because that exchange program give me the opportunity to grow as person.</p>
